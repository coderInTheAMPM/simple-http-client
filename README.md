Rust client script that downloads contents from the buggy server run from [this script](https://gist.github.com/vladimirlagunov/dcdf90bb19e9de306344d46f20920dce).
All it does is it downloads it in 50KB chunks to avoid the glitching added in the server script.
It has one external library, for the SHA256 encoding.
